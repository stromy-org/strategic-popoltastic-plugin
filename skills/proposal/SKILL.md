# Consulting Proposal Builder

## Overview

This skill produces polished consulting proposals, executive briefs, capability statements, and bid documents. It is **format-agnostic** — it owns the proposal domain logic (structure, content strategy, quality gates) and delegates formatting to output skills.

**This skill provides the *what*** — proposal structure, content assembly from company data, interactive intake, and quality gates.
**Format skills provide the *how*** — the `docx` skill for Word documents, `pptx` for presentations, `pdf` for PDF export.

Use this skill when a user asks to:
- Write or generate a consulting proposal
- Create an executive brief or capability statement
- Revise, update, or refresh an existing proposal
- Merge content from multiple proposal sources
- Condense a full proposal into a shorter format
- Build a bid document or statement of work
- Respond to a client brief with a formal proposal

## Company Data Integration

This skill draws from structured company data stored in `companies/<company-name>/`.

### Discovery

1. **Default**: Use `companies/strategicpopoltastic/` (the Strategic Popoltastic brand). Override only if the user explicitly names a different company.
2. If multiple companies exist and the user names one, use that company
3. If no company data exists for the named company, fall back to `companies/strategicpopoltastic/` for missing fields
5. After loading company data, check for `people.json` — use it for "Prepared by" and contact sections (filter by `roles` containing `"author"`, auto-select if `"default": true`)

### Loading Company Data

```
companies/<name>/profile.json       → Company identity, services, pricing, credentials, legal
companies/<name>/brand/charter.json  → Visual identity (colors, fonts, logo, format settings)
companies/<name>/proposals/           → Proposal content library:
  ├── case-studies.json      → Past performance
  ├── team-bios.json         → Key personnel with bio variants
  ├── methodologies.json     → Standard approaches/frameworks
  ├── boilerplate.json       → Assumptions, disclaimers, legal terms
  ├── testimonials.json      → Client quotes
  ├── differentiators.json   → Win themes and competitive positioning
  └── partnerships.json      → Technology and strategic partnerships
```

For full schema documentation, see [company-data-schema.md](references/company-data-schema.md).

### Content Library Assembly

Map library items to proposal sections by matching tags, service IDs, and industry relevance:

| Proposal Section | Content Source | Selection Criteria |
|------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Client Context | Manual (from brief/RFP) | — |
| Approach & Methodology | `methodologies.json` | Match by `applicableServices` or tags |
| Team & Qualifications | `team-bios.json` | Match by `expertise` tags; use `executive` or `technical` variant based on audience |
| Relevant Experience | `case-studies.json` | Match by `tags` (industry, service type); use `short` or `long` variant based on depth |
| Pricing & Investment | `profile.json` → `pricing.models` | Match by service's `pricingModel` reference |
| Risk Management | `boilerplate.json` → `assumptions` | Standard assumptions + engagement-specific ones |
| Terms & Conditions | `boilerplate.json` → `legalTerms` | Standard terms from `profile.json` → `legal.standardTerms` |
| Proof Points (inline) | `testimonials.json` | Match by `tags` and `caseStudy` reference |
| Win Themes (inline) | `differentiators.json` | Match by `applicableServices` or tags; thread throughout proposal |
| Partnership Proof (inline) | `partnerships.json` | Match by `relevantServices`; use in Team & Qualifications or Credentials |

## Interactive Intake Workflow

The proposal process begins with a structured conversation to gather requirements before writing.

### Phase 1 — Signal

User provides:
- Client brief, RFP, or verbal description of the opportunity
- Which company is proposing (if multiple profiles exist)

### Phase 2 — Smart Interview

For common B2B scenarios, a quick-setup path can shortcut configuration using proposal archetypes. See [archetypes.md](references/archetypes.md) for presets.

Ask **only questions that genuinely add value** — skip anything deducible from the brief. Aim for 3-5 focused questions, adapting based on what's already known.

**Always ask:**
- What depth: executive brief (2-4 pages) or full proposal (15-25 pages)?
- Which pricing model? (present options from `profile.json` → `pricing.models`)

**Ask if not clear from brief:**
- What's the primary pain point to emphasize?
- Which team members to highlight or exclude?
- Any sections to skip or emphasize?
- Target audience: technical evaluators, executives, or mixed?
- Competitive context: sole-source or competitive bid?

**Never ask:**
- Questions answered in the brief/RFP
- Generic questions that don't change the output
- Questions about the company's own capabilities (that's in the data layer)

For detailed guidance, see [intake-workflow.md](references/intake-workflow.md).

### Phase 3 — Strategy

Present a content plan for user approval before writing:

1. **Proposed sections** — which sections from the skeleton to include, with rationale
2. **Content selections** — which case studies, team members, and methodology to feature (with reasons)
3. **Pricing structure** — proposed pricing model and breakdown approach
4. **Key differentiators** — 3-5 win themes to thread through the proposal
5. **Output format** — DOCX, PPTX, or PDF (confirm with user)
6. **Archetype** — which proposal archetype best fits (Corporate, Consultant, Entrepreneur, Creative, Minimal). See [archetypes.md](references/archetypes.md)

Wait for user approval before proceeding to Phase 4.

### Phase 4 — Production

Execute the proposal workflow (Steps 1-7 below). Claude will produce the document in the chosen output format.

### Phase 5 — Review

Present the draft to the user with a quality gate summary. Run the checklists from [quality-gates.md](references/quality-gates.md) and flag any issues.

## Editing Modes

Choose the correct mode based on what the user needs:

### Create New
Start from a brief, template, or verbal description and produce a complete proposal.
→ Run intake workflow (Phases 1-3), then workflow Steps 1-7 below.

### Revise Existing
Update scope, pricing, staffing, case studies, or other sections in an existing proposal without breaking formatting.
→ Edit the existing document in place, or use the redlining workflow if tracked changes are needed.

### Merge Sections
Combine content from multiple source documents (e.g., prior proposals, boilerplate library, SME drafts) into a single cohesive proposal.
→ Extract content from sources, then follow Create New workflow with pre-written section content.

### Condense
Shorten a full proposal to N pages (e.g., produce a 2-page executive brief from a 40-page proposal).
→ Read the full proposal, identify key messages per section, then Create New with a reduced skeleton (see condensed format mapping in [sections.md](references/sections.md)).

**Decision tree:**
1. Does a proposal document already exist? → **Revise** or **Condense**
2. Are there multiple source documents to unify? → **Merge**
3. Starting from scratch or a brief? → **Create New**

## Standard Proposal Skeleton

The canonical section order for a full consulting proposal. Not every proposal needs every section — adapt based on scope and formality.

| # | Section | Purpose |
|---|---------|---------|
| 1 | Cover Page | First impression — client name, project title, date, firm branding |
| 2 | Table of Contents | Navigation — auto-generated from heading styles |
| 3 | Executive Summary | The pitch — written *last*, distills scope + differentiators + key proof points |
| 4 | Client Context | Shows understanding — restate the client's situation, challenges, and goals |
| 5 | Objectives | Alignment — what success looks like, measurable where possible |
| 6 | Approach & Methodology | The "how" — phased approach, frameworks, tools, techniques |
| 7 | Work Plan & Timeline | The schedule — phases, milestones, dependencies, Gantt or table format |
| 8 | Deliverables | What the client receives — tangible outputs with descriptions |
| 9 | Team & Qualifications | Who delivers — key personnel, roles, relevant credentials |
| 10 | Relevant Experience | Proof — case studies, past performance, client references |
| 11 | Pricing & Investment | The ask — fee structure, payment terms, what's included/excluded |
| 12 | Risk Management | Confidence — identified risks, mitigation strategies, assumptions |
| 13 | Terms & Conditions | Legal — engagement terms, IP, confidentiality, liability |
| 14 | Appendices | Supporting detail — resumes, detailed methodologies, certifications |
| 15 | Next Steps | Call to action — what happens after acceptance, contact information |

**Key rule**: The Executive Summary is always written *last*, after all other sections are finalized. It synthesizes the final scope, differentiators, and strongest proof points.

For detailed guidance on each section, see [sections.md](references/sections.md).

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Document Plan

1. Select editing mode (Create / Revise / Merge / Condense)
2. Choose which sections from the skeleton are needed (full proposal vs. exec brief vs. capability statement)
3. Map content library items to sections:
   - Case studies → Relevant Experience (match by tags to client industry/service)
   - Team bios → Team & Qualifications (select `executive` or `technical` variant based on audience)
   - Methodologies → Approach & Methodology (match by `applicableServices`)
   - Boilerplate → Risk Management, Terms & Conditions
   - Pricing models → Pricing & Investment (from `profile.json`)
4. Identify gaps — content that needs to be written fresh vs. pulled from library
5. Note any client-specific formatting requirements (page limits, required sections, naming conventions)

### Step 2 — Section Drafting

Draft each section following the guidance in [sections.md](references/sections.md):

- **Pull from content library first** — reuse and adapt case studies, bios, and methodology descriptions before writing new content
- **Substantiate every claim** — each assertion needs a proof point (case study reference, metric with source, certification)
- **Write for the evaluator** — lead with the answer, then provide supporting detail
- **Maintain consistent voice** — same tense, same level of formality, same terminology throughout
- **Skip the executive summary** — it gets written in Step 4

### Step 3 — Assembly

Produce the document in the chosen output format. Pass the following context to the format production workflow:

- **Brand charter**: `companies/<name>/brand/charter.json`
- **Logo**: `companies/<name>/brand/logos/` (path in charter `logo` section)
- **Drafted sections**: the content from Step 2
- **Tone and archetype**: from intake Phase 2/3

The appropriate format skill handles document production:
- DOCX output → the `docx` skill handles Word document creation
- PPTX output → the `pptx` skill handles branded presentations
- PDF output → generate via DOCX conversion or a PDF creation workflow
- HTML output → the `frontend-design` skill handles web-native proposals

### Step 4 — Executive Summary

Write the executive summary last, synthesizing:
- **The opportunity** — 1-2 sentences on the client's situation and need
- **The solution** — what you're proposing, at the highest level
- **Key differentiators** — why this firm, why this team, why this approach (2-3 bullets)
- **Proof points** — strongest evidence (metrics, case studies, credentials)
- **The investment** — total cost and timeline at a glance
- **Call to action** — next step to move forward

Target length: 1-2 pages. An executive should be able to read only this section and make an informed decision.

### Step 5 — Layout Validation

Before quality gates, verify visual presentation:
- Cover page renders correctly with branding
- Table of contents is generated and accurate
- Page breaks fall before major sections
- Tables don't split across pages awkwardly
- Headers and footers appear consistently
- No orphan headings (heading at bottom of page, content on next)
- Consistent spacing between sections

Convert DOCX to images (DOCX → PDF via LibreOffice → images via pdftoppm) to visually inspect output.

### Step 6 — Quality Gates

Run the quality checklist. See [quality-gates.md](references/quality-gates.md) for the full detailed checklists.

**Quick reference:**

| Gate | Check |
|------|-------|
| Content completeness | Every required section exists with substantive content; no TBD, placeholders, or lorem ipsum |
| Claim substantiation | Every claim has a proof source (case study ID, metric source, internal reference) |
| Section coherence | No contradictions between sections; pricing matches scope; timeline matches deliverables |
| Visual consistency | Cover page present, TOC generated, heading styles consistent, page numbers present |
| Formatting hygiene | All formatting via styles (no manual), no orphan headings, tables don't split badly |
| Cross-references | All "see Section X" references point to actual sections; all appendix references valid |

### Step 7 — Packaging

Produce final deliverables:
1. **Final document** — in the requested format (DOCX, PPTX, PDF)
2. **PDF export** (if requested) — convert via LibreOffice or a PDF creation workflow
3. **Email summary** (if requested) — 10-bullet summary suitable for forwarding to the client as a cover email

## Quality Gates — Quick Reference

These are the high-level checks. For detailed per-section checklists and common failure modes, see [quality-gates.md](references/quality-gates.md).

**Content completeness**
- Every section in the document plan exists and has substantive content
- No "TBD", "[placeholder]", "[insert here]", or lorem ipsum text
- Word/page targets met for each section

**Claim substantiation**
- Every capability claim has a supporting reference (case study, metric, certification)
- No vague claims without evidence ("we are industry leaders" → needs proof)
- Metrics include source and timeframe

**Section coherence**
- Pricing aligns with the scope described in Approach & Methodology
- Timeline aligns with deliverables and milestones
- Team composition matches the approach (right skills for the proposed methods)
- No contradictions between sections

**Visual consistency**
- Cover page has correct client name, project title, date, branding
- Table of contents is present and accurate
- Heading styles are consistent (all H1s look the same, all H2s look the same)
- Page numbers present in footer; headers have firm/project name

**Formatting hygiene**
- All formatting uses styles (no manual bold/italic/font-size for headings)
- No orphan headings at page bottoms
- Tables don't split across pages in confusing ways
- Consistent paragraph spacing throughout

## Customization

### Client Branding

Brand data is loaded from `companies/<name>/brand/charter.json`. The charter covers all output formats:

- **`document`** section → DOCX margins, headers, footers, heading colors
- **`presentation`** section → PPTX slide margins, aspect ratio
- **`video`** section → Remotion resolution, fps

If no company data exists, accept brand parameters as manual inputs:
- **Primary color** — used for headings, cover page accents
- **Secondary color** — used for subheadings, table headers
- **Fonts** — heading font, body font
- **Logo** — file path for cover page placement

### Tone & Voice

Accept tone parameters and apply consistently:
- **Formality**: formal / conversational (default: formal)
- **Audience**: technical / executive / mixed (default: executive)
- **Stance**: assertive / consultative / neutral (default: consultative)
- **Default voice**: Professional, confident, specific. Avoid jargon without explanation. Lead with outcomes, support with methods.

### Evidence Rules

Define what counts as proof and how to cite it:
- **Case study reference**: `[CS-ID]` with client name (if permitted), industry, outcome metric
- **Metric citation**: Number + source + timeframe (e.g., "reduced cycle time by 35% — ABC Corp engagement, 2024")
- **Certification reference**: Certification name + issuing body + current status
- **Client name usage**: Check `namePublic` flag in case study — use name only if `true`, otherwise use industry descriptor

## Output Location

Proposals follow the standard workspace project structure:

```
workspace/<client>/
├── build/<deliverable>/    ← build scripts and intermediates
└── output/<deliverable>/   ← final proposal files (docx, pptx, pdf)
```

**Override**: If the prompt specifies a target output directory, pass it through to the output format skill.
**Discovery**: Before creating new output, check the project's `output/` folder for existing deliverables. Briefly mention what you find, then proceed with the current task.

## Output Format Production

This skill owns proposal content strategy. Document production is handled by the appropriate format skill:

| Output | Skill | What it provides |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| DOCX | `docx` | Word document creation with docx-js, OOXML editing, redlining |
| PPTX | `pptx` | Branded presentation creation with html2pptx workflow |
| PDF | `pdf` | PDF creation, conversion, merging |
| XLSX | `xlsx` | Spreadsheet creation for pricing models |

Brand context to carry forward:
- Brand charter location: `companies/<name>/brand/charter.json`
- Apply heading color from `colors.primary`, body font from `fonts.body`, logo from `brand/logos/` (path in charter `logo` section)
